# Global Patterns in structural habitat complexity.
---
Briefly, the scripts contained in the respository follow the analysis sequence presented in is study comprised the following sequence of steps: generating global maps of selected complexity indices; assessing the scale ensitivity of these complexity indices; quantifying pairwise geometric relationships; evaluating ecosystem and land use type associated complexity characteristics; and visualising these quantified relationships and patterns.
